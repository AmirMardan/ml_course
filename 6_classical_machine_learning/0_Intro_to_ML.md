# 6. What Is Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that build a mathematical model of data to help understand data.
By giving *tunable parameters* to the model which can be adapted to observed data, *learning* occurs. 
Once the model has been fit to previously observed data, it can *predict* based on new observed data.

## Categories of Machine Learning
Machine learning problems can be categorized into two main classes:
- **Supervised learning** build a relationship between measured features and some labels associated with the data. 
This category is subdivided into *classification* with discrete labels ans and *regression* with continuous labels.
- **Unsupervised learning** build the model of data without considering any labels involved in the the data.
This is the concept of "letting the dataset speak for itself".
Unsupervised learning is subdivided to *clustering* and *dimensionality reduction* tasks.
Clustering algorithms put the observed data in different categories while the dimensionality reduction techniques are provided to find more efficient repersentations of the data.

There is also **semi-supervised learning** which falls between supervised and unsupervised methods.
